Regression Problem


---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this mini-project, the goal is to tackle a challenging regression problem. The project involves cleaning the dataset, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), applying transformations, conducting statistical tests, and preparing the data for various Machine Learning (ML) models. The models to be developed include baseline regressors, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and a model with Convolutional layers followed by ANN layers.

## 📊 Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- **🧼 Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
- **🔍 EDA:** Visualize the data to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- **🔄 Data Transformations:** Apply necessary transformations (e.g., normalization, encoding) to prepare the data for modeling.

## 📉 Step 2: Baseline Regressors

We begin by training several baseline regression models:

1. **📈 Linear Regression**
2. **💻 Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **🌲 Random Forest Regressor**
4. **🌳 Decision Tree**
5. **🚀 Gradient Boosting**

Each model's performance will be evaluated based on:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared (R²)**
- **Training Time**

🔍 **Insights:** Visualize and compare the performance metrics to determine the best-performing model.

## 🧠 Step 3: ANN Model

Next, we build and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network (ANN):

- **📐 Architecture:** Sequential model with Dense layers.
- **🔧 Training:** Monitor loss and MAE across 200 epochs.
- **📊 Visualization:** Plot error curves (training vs. validation) to detect any signs of overfitting or underfitting.

## 📡 Step 4: Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D) + ANN

Finally, we develop a model combining 1D Convolutional layers with Dense layers:

- **📐 Architecture:** Conv1D layers followed by Dense layers.
- **🔧 Training:** Monitor loss and MAE across 200 epochs.
- **📊 Visualization:** Plot error curves to evaluate the model’s performance and identify potential overfitting or underfitting.

## 🛠️ Step 5: Statistical Tests & Hypothesis Testing

- **🔍 Hypothesis Tests:** Perform relevant statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA, t-test) to validate assumptions and analyze relationships between variables.
- **📊 Correlation Analysis:** Evaluate the strength of relationships between features using Pearson correlation.

## 📈 Visualizations & Findings

- **🖼️ EDA Plots:** Provide insights into data distribution, correlations, and potential outliers.
- **📊 Model Performance Charts:** Compare and analyze model performance.
- **📉 Error Curves:** Identify overfitting or underfitting in ANN and Conv1D models.

🔍 **Key Findings:** Summarize the most important observations from the visualizations and statistical tests.
